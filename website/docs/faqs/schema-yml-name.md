title: Does my test file need to be named `schema.yml`?
---
No! You can name this file whatever you want (including `whatever_you_want.yml`), so long as:
* The file is in your `models/` directory
* The file has `.yml` extension
* The yaml follows the basic structure.

Check out the [docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/declaring-properties) for more information.
