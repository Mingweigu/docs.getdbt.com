Every [dbt project](projects) needs a `dbt_project.yml` file â€” this is how dbt knows a directory is a dbt project. It also contains important information that tells dbt how to operate on your project.

    dbt uses YAML in a few different places. If you're new to YAML, it would be worth taking the time to learn how arrays, dictionaries and strings are represented.
