#### meta

<Changelog> Added in v0.16.0 </Changelog>

The `meta` field can be used to set metadata for a model. This metadata is compiled into the `manifest.json` file generated by dbt, and is viewable in the auto-generated documentation. Example:

```yml
models:
  - name: users
    meta:
      contains_pii: true
      owner: "@alice"
    columns:
      - name: email
        # Add a "pii" tag to this column, and all associated tests
        tags:
          - pii
```
